# Terms of Reference: E-RIHS Reviewer

As a member of the E-RIHS Peer Review Panelist (reviewer) for the access proposals submitted to E-RIHS, your role is essential in ensuring the highest standards of academic integrity and excellence.

By agreeing to serve as a Reviewer, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to comply with the following Terms of Reference:

## Conflict of Interest

You must disclose any actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that could affect your impartiality, arising from personal, professional, financial, or other relationships with the applicants or their institutions. Should a conflict arise, you will be asked to recuse yourself from reviewing the affected project to maintain fairness.

## Confidentiality

As a reviewer, you will gain access to sensitive and proprietary information related to the submitted projects as indicated in the Confidentiality Policy. 

## Impartiality and Objectivity

You agree to avoid any bias related to gender, nationality, ethnicity, or institutional affiliation. Feedback should be clear, constructive, and respectful, aiding both applicants and the review committee in assessing the project.

## Timeliness

You agree to complete the review within the specified deadlines. If you are unable to meet the timeline, you must notify [helpdesk@e-rihs.eu](mailto:helpdesk@e-rihs.eu) promptly. Failure to meet deadlines without prior notice may lead to removal from the Peer Review Panel for future opportunities.

## Transparency and Accountability

Your evaluation must be transparent, well-documented, and supported by clear justifications for your recommendations and scores. E-RIHS may also request your feedback on the review process for future improvements.

## Voluntary Duty

Your role as a reviewer is voluntary, and unless otherwise stated, you will not receive compensation for your time and effort. Your contribution is appreciated as part of the broader scientific community's commitment to advancing research excellence. E-RIHS can provide certification of this voluntary role upon request.

## Intellectual Property

You agree to respect the intellectual property rights of the applicants. You will not use any unpublished data, methods, or results from the project proposals for your own research or other purposes without explicit permission.

## Legal Compliance

You agree to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations, including those related to data protection, intellectual property, and research ethics, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) where applicable.

## Termination 

You may withdraw from the review process at any time by notifying [helpdesk@e-rihs.eu](mailto:helpdesk@e-rihs.eu). However, we kindly ask that withdrawal should not occur without valid reason, especially once a review process has started. E-RIHS reserves the right to remove you as a reviewer for non-compliance with these terms, misconduct, or failure to meet deadlines.

## Liability

E-RIHS is not liable for any loss or damage you may incur during your participation as a reviewer. You understand that your involvement does not establish any legal relationship beyond the scope of these Terms of Reference.

## Amendments

E-RIHS reserves the right to modify these Terms of Reference at any time. You will be informed of any substantial changes, and your continued participation will signify your acceptance of the revised terms.

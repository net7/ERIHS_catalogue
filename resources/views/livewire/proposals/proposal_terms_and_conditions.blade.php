        I hereby acknowledge and agree with the following obligations should Access to E-RIHS be granted:

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 30px; font-size: 15px; color: #555;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
            I declare that the proposal does not pertain to an authentication study.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
            I confirm that I have or have sought legal permission to study the heritage asset and shall provide the
            necessary documentation in the case of being granted access.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
            That a User Report with preliminary considerations will be uploaded in the User group leader dashboard no
            later than 2 months following Access (the template and relative instructions will be provided). The report
            and related photos will be uploaded on the E-RIHS website and the E-RIHS Zenodo community and released
            under the CC-BY-NC license.

            supported by mobility funding, the following statement is suggested, to be adapted as appropriate: "The
            authors acknowledge E-RIHS, the European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science, for providing

            invited communication, seminar, blogs etc. – are subject to the same standards as publications and shall
            be timely communicated to <a href="mailto:co@e-rihs.eu">co@e-rihs.eu</a>.
